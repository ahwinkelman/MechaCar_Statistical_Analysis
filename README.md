## Linear Regression to Predict MPH

1. vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle, and AWD provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values. All three variables have a p-value that is greater than .05 which indicates statisical significance.  
2. The p-value is lass than 0 (5.35e-11), which indicates that slope is not equal to zero.
3. The r-squared value is .7149 which means that that the model predictions are correct 71% of the time. I dont believe that this linear model effectively predicts mpg of MechaCar Prototypes because it is only accurate 71% of the time meaning the is nearly 30% of outcomes that are incorrect.
